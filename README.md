# 🌟 About Me

Hi, I’m **Shruti Agre** – a backend-focused developer who believes great APIs should be as expressive as a great painting (and I do that too 🎨).

👩‍💻 **Java & Spring Boot Enthusiast**
From building user-authenticated blog platforms to managing role-based access with precision, I enjoy writing clean, maintainable code with a backend-first mindset. My REST APIs aren’t just functional — they’re thoughtfully structured and thoroughly tested.

🧠 **Problem Solver by Skill, Artist by Soul**
When I’m not debugging, I’m probably sketching, painting, or dancing. I believe creativity fuels logic, and that balance makes me both a coder and a creator.

🛠️ **Skilled In**
`Java | Spring Boot | REST API | Hibernate | MySQL | HTML | CSS | JS | JQuery | Bootstrap`

🌱 **Currently Exploring**

* JWT Security & OAuth2
* Docker Basics
* Data Structures & Algorithms
* Building full-stack projects with clean architecture

🎯 **What Drives Me**
The joy of solving real-world problems and creating user-centric solutions that work seamlessly under the hood.
